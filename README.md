Integrated Control Environment for OpenGL
=========================================

Overview
--------
This AAR library allows the creation of a user interface in Android and OpenGL 2.0.  With this you can easily add buttons, labels, and more to an Android application.  The goal is to allow you the game developer to focus on your game, not the menu screen structure.  

Features
--------
* Grid based system - similar to some web frameworks, you can specify placement and size of controls based on a 12x12 grid layout - more specific positioning is available if required as well.
* Single Activity - multiple screens
* Various Controls already supplied, such as:
 * Label
 * Button
 * Textbox
 * Checked Button
* Extensible - extend the Control abstract class to add your own custom controls!

Requirements
------------
* Font File - add your own font to your assets folder - rename to font.ttf to automate using it as default.
* Android Studio - built on Android studio 1.1 Beta 1
* Default button graphics are supplied, but I highly recommend usingsomething.. prettier instead.
