Integrated Control Environment for OpenGL
=========================================

API Documentation: http://terence-d.github.io/IceGL/

This library allows the creation of a user interface in Android and OpenGL 2.0.  With this you can easily add buttons, labels, and more to an Android application.  The goal is to allow you the game developer to focus on your game, not the menu screen structure.  

This is built with Android Studio and is designed for OpenGL ES 2.0.

Current controls supported:
Label 
Button
Textbox
Checked Button

You will need to supply a font and should probably replace the button graphics.  More information on this will be forthcoming.
